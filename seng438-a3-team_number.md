# 1 Introduction

This lab we used several tools, including manual calculations, to calculate the coverage of methods in DataUtilities class and Range class. First the coverage was calculated using only tests written in assignment 2 using black box methods, then, using white box testing, more tests were developed to improve coverage for all coverage types. 

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

See images SENG438_Lab3_DataUtilCFG and SENG438_Lab3_RangeCFG in folder "images" to view the data-flow coverage for methods DataUtilitise.CalculateColumnTotal and Range.Equal respectively. 

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

One group member created CFG for methods calculateColumnTotal from DataUtilitise and equal from Range class. Using the diagrams to do manual calculations as specified in section 3.2.
2 group members worked on created additional tests for all methods to improve coverage.
Another group member focused on testing varyious coverage tools to find the coverage metrics from using tests only from assignment two and and then the new metrics after aditional test creations.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Instructions in section 3.3 could be updated to explicitly state that we need to write tests to cover ALL methods in class Range not just the 5 methods used in assignment 2.
Several images in the lab instruction document could not be viewed and made troubleshooting difficult as there was nothing to visually refrence.
