# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Test case for Range.combineIgnoringNaN with two valid ranges: This test case is designed to ensure that the method can handle two valid ranges and correctly combines them. It covers the "normal" equivalence class for both input parameters and increases statement, branch, and condition coverage.

Test case for Range.combineIgnoringNaN with one NaN range: This test case is designed to ensure that the method can handle NaN values and ignores them as expected. It covers the "one NaN range" equivalence class for both input parameters and increases statement, branch, and condition coverage.

Test case for Range.contains with a value within the range: This test case is designed to ensure that the method correctly identifies a value within the range. It covers the "value within the range" equivalence class and increases statement and branch coverage.

Test case for Range.contains with a value outside the range: This test case is designed to ensure that the method correctly identifies a value outside the range. It covers the "value outside the range" equivalence class and increases statement and branch coverage.

Test case for Range.intersects with two ranges with no intersection: This test case is designed to ensure that the method correctly identifies when two ranges have no intersection. It covers the "no intersection" equivalence class for both input parameters and increases statement, branch, and condition coverage.
